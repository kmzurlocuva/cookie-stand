#Welcome to Pat's Cookies Web Site!

This is a Web site designed to promote Pat's cookies as well as create re-produceable business projections for Pat, the salmon cookie maker. It has been designed with exceptionally simple design frameworks in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The site was additionally built using the following elements:

* normalize.css v3.0.2 | MIT License | git.io/normalize
* Skeleton V2.0.4 | Copyright 2014, Dave Gamache (for the data page only)
* Sara Vieira's CSS techniques from webdesignerdepot.com (box shadows)
* image of Seattle from blog.hodgsonmeyers.com

Site Objectives:
* Develop a hidden site for business data projections for Pat:

* Provide a clean and simple site to promote Pat's business, displaying his passion for salmon and leading with the sales of his products, both cookies by location and merchandise for sale.
* Promote the look and feel of Pat's brand, actualized through the style sheet:
