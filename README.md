#Salmon cookie business for Code Fellows 201 course 12/2015

This is a Web site designed to promote Pat's cookies as well as create re-produceable business projections for Pat, the salmon cookie maker. It has been designed with exceptionally simple design frameworks in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. The site was addition build using the following elements:

* normalize.css v3.0.2 | MIT License | git.io/normalize
* Skeleton V2.0.4 | Copyright 2014, Dave Gamache (for the data page only)
* Sara Vieira's CSS techniques from webdesignerdepot.com (box shadows)
* image of Seattle from blog.hodgsonmeyers.com

The elements of the Web site were developed by Kate Zurlo-Cuva, as part of a week-long exercise for her Code Fellows 201 Course.

All aspects of this site are marginally useful and can be used by anyone who desires them without concern for crediting the author.
